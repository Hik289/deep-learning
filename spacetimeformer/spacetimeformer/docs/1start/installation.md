Installation
==============

To use spacetimeformer, you must be running Python 3.6+. Tensorflow needs to be installed for users. A CUDA-compatible GPU is optional but will greatly improve speed. To install, simply run

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/QData/spacetimeformer.git
cd spacetimeformer
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

You're now all set to use spacetimeformer!
